# Utilizing the Python API in Blender
**Electricity FX in a Sci-Fi setting** \
These two weeks were mostly spent in learning how to use the Python API in Blender to create and modify objects, light and camera settings, and  how to animate them using keyframes and available tools on Blender.

The video tutorial I used as reference for this animation is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4UWvg6ixho \
The Procedural Sci-Fi Panel material in the **assets** folder was obtained from the **BlenderKit** add-on on Blender. \
The audio file TQ7E6ZX-electricity.mp3 used in the rendering of the animation was obtained from [here](https://elements.envato.com/electricity-TQ7E6ZX?utm_source=mixkit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=elements_mixkit_cs_sfx_tag&_ga=2.235051145.943345727.1658231442-884869325.1658231442).

electricity.py is the python script that gives you the whole model ready in 3D viewport when run. \
The animation using keyframe and modifiers was done manually by me and all the keyframe settings I used can be accessed using the elec.blend file.\
elec_fx.mp4 is the final rendered animation.

# My First Blender Project
**A delicious Donut served with the exotic Espresso Martini, in an aesthetic environment.** \
First experience with 3D modelling and Blender. \
Mostly followed the YouTube tutorials from this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U

donut.blend is the Blender file containing all the 3D models. \
donut_base.png is the 2D texture shading, UV mapped to the base of the donut. \
Donut.jpg is the rendered image.
